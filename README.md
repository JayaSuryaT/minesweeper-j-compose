# Minesweeper w/ `Jetpack Compose`

This is a [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game))-like puzzle game, built using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), for Android.

The objective of this game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each cell.

* Haptic & Aural feedback
* Day / Night theme
* Animating gradient cell background
* Randomly generated levels

## Controls : 
* Tap a cell to reveal it
